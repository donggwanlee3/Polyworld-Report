In the course of my project utilizing the PolyWorld model, I encountered several significant challenges that required both technical understanding and logistical adjustments. Initially, comprehending the underlying algorithm, I had to watch explanatory videos on YouTube and throughly read the paper. My MacBook lacked a suitable NVIDIA GPU, compelling me to utilize Google Colab’s built-in GPU capabilities for processing efficiency, as local processing was projected to take an  duration of four days. Additionally, the project demanded the upload of 60,000 images to Google Drive, a process that extended over three days and required continuous operation of my computer to prevent interruptions. I also had to familiarize myself with Google Colab’s file system interactions.
